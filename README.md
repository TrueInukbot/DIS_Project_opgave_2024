To start of download the repository.
when you have a copy of the repository you need to do the following:

In run.py, find lines 20, 21, 49, and 50, and change them to your PostgreSQL user and password.

In config.py, change the same information in line 3.

In setup.bat or .sh, only use the username.

Now, open the terminal and type python run.py.
After that, open a browser and go to 127.0.0.1/5000 (or which ever the terminal tells the application is running on).
